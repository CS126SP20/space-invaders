# Space Invaders

My game idea is to build a version of Space Invaders in Cinder. The player will have a ship that they can control that can shoot bullets from and aliens that come down from the top that the player needs to shot down. The player wins if they kill all the aliens and lose if the aliens reach the bottom.

I do not have any specific experience with this project, but reading through the code for the Snake game gave me some of an idea on how to approach a simple game like this. I do enjoy playing classic arcade games like these so I would like to see this project to its completion.

I plan to use [Cinder-poSpriteSheet](https://github.com/Potion/Cinder-poSpritesheet) for sprites and animation as well as [Cinder-poScene](https://github.com/Potion/Cinder-poScene) for views.

In the first week, I hope to get the general graphics for the game implemented and potentially the player. By the second week, I hope to get the player and the shooting implemented and get a start on the aliens. By the third week, I hope to have the aliens implemented as well as scoring.

If I were to finish early, I could try to add an automated player and/or different difficulty levels with a different number of aliens for each one.
